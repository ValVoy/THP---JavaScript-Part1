# JS Exercises – Pre-Course Project

## Description

This project contains several JavaScript exercises designed to practice the basics of the language and data structures.  
It covers:  

- Console output  
- Variables and `prompt` usage  
- Loops (`for`) and conditions (`if`)  
- Functions and objects  
- Arrays and common methods (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `sort`)  
- Simplified RNA-to-protein translation

Each exercise is independent in a `.js` file.

## Exercises Overview

1. **Hello / Greet (`script_1.js`)**
   - Prints `"Hello, world!"` to the console.  
   - Prompts the user for their name and prints `"Hello, Name!"`.

2. **Quick Calculations (`script_2.js`)**
   - Calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.  
   - Example: `factorial(5) = 120`.  
   - Uses a function to perform the calculation.

3. **Mario Pyramid (`script_3.js`)**
   - Displays a pyramid of `#` in the console.  
   - The height is chosen by the user.  
   - Uses loops and string repetition.

4. **Entrepreneurs (`script_4.js`)**
   - Works with an array of objects (`first`, `last`, `year`).  
   - Exercises include:  
     - Filtering entrepreneurs born in the 1970s  
     - Creating a new array of first and last names  
     - Calculating the current age of each entrepreneur  
     - Sorting entrepreneurs alphabetically by last name

5. **Librarian (`script_5.js`)**
   - Works with an array of books (`title`, `id`, `rented`).  
   - Exercises include:  
     - Checking if all books have been rented at least once  
     - Finding the most and least rented books  
     - Finding a book by ID  
     - Removing a book by ID  
     - Sorting books alphabetically

6. **The Code of Life – RNA Translation (`script_6.js`)**
   - Translates an RNA sequence into a series of amino acids.  
   - Splits the RNA string into codons (3 letters each)  
   - Translates each codon to an amino acid using a simplified genetic code  
   - Example:  
     ```
     "UUACGCAGUAGA" → "UUA | CGC | AGU | AGA" → "Leucine-Arginine-Serine-Arginine"
     ```

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Console and prompt for user interaction

## Learning Goals

- Master basic JavaScript: variables, loops, conditions, functions
- Manipulate arrays and objects
- Understand built-in methods (map, filter, reduce, sort, every, find)
- Approach real algorithmic problems (factorial, pyramid, RNA translation)
